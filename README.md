# Enhancing-Wildlife-Preservation-through-YOLOv8-Based-Animal-Recognition
 This project uses YOLOv8 with a Flask web app for real-time wildlife detection. Users upload images to detect animals, receive email alerts if humans are found, and view results with bounding boxes. Data is stored per user in a MySQL database, aiding conservation through automated, scalable monitoring.
